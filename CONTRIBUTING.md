## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Fast Python package manager

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ptcg-placeholder
```

2. Install uv (if not already installed)
```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

3. Install project dependencies
```bash
uv sync
```

This will automatically create a virtual environment and install all necessary dependencies (including dev dependencies).

## Running Tests

### Run all tests

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

### Run specific test files

```bash
# Test card designer only
uv run pytest tests/test_card_designer.py -v

# Test PDF generator only
uv run pytest tests/test_pdf_generator.py -v

# Test utility functions only
uv run pytest tests/test_utils.py -v
```

### Test coverage

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

Coverage report will be generated in the `htmlcov/` directory.

### Testing workflow when developing new features

1. Write tests first (TDD approach, optional)
2. Implement the feature
3. Run tests to ensure all tests pass
```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```
4. Verify no existing functionality is broken

## Release Process

### Automated Release (Recommended)

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated build and release workflow.

#### Steps

1. **Update version number**

Edit `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[project]
version = "1.2.0"  # Update version number
```

2. **Commit changes**

```bash
git add pyproject.toml
git commit -m "Bump version to 1.2.0"
git push
```

3. **Create and push Git tag**

```bash
# Create tag (must prefix with 'v')
git tag v1.2.0

# Push tag to GitHub
git push origin v1.2.0
```

4. **Automated workflow**

After pushing the tag, GitHub Actions will automatically:
- ✅ Run all tests
- 🏗️ Build executables for three platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- 📦 Create a GitHub Release
- ⬆️ Upload executables to the Release

You can monitor the build progress on the GitHub Actions page.

### Manual Trigger (Optional)

To manually trigger a build without creating a release:

1. Go to your GitHub project page
2. Click the "Actions" tab
3. Select "Build and Release Executables"
4. Click "Run workflow"

### Version Numbering Rules

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.2.0`)
  - **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
  - **MINOR**: Backwards-compatible functionality additions
  - **PATCH**: Backwards-compatible bug fixes

Examples:
- `1.0.0` → `1.0.1`: Bug fix
- `1.0.1` → `1.1.0`: New feature
- `1.1.0` → `2.0.0`: Breaking change

### Pre-releases (Beta Testing)

To create a pre-release for testing:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0-beta.1
git push origin v1.0.0-beta.1
```

The workflow will create a pre-release (marked with "Pre-release" label on GitHub).

### Rolling Back a Release

If you need to delete a bad release:

```bash
# Delete the tag locally
git tag -d v1.0.0

# Delete the tag on GitHub
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0
```

Then manually delete the Release on GitHub:
1. Go to Releases page
2. Click the release you want to delete
3. Click "Delete release"

### Better Commit Messages

To make automated release notes more useful, use conventional commits:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add support for Gen 9 Pokemon"
git commit -m "fix: correct DPI metadata handling"
git commit -m "docs: update README with new examples"
```

Common prefixes:
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

## Development Workflow

### Adding a new feature

1. Create a new branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Develop the feature and write tests

3. Run tests to ensure they pass
```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

4. Commit changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: your feature description"
```

5. Push and create a Pull Request
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Fixing a bug

1. Create a new branch
```bash
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

2. Write a test to reproduce the bug (if possible)

3. Fix the bug

4. Verify tests pass
```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

5. Commit and create a Pull Request

## CI/CD Explanation

### Test Workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)

- **Trigger**: Every push to `master`/`main` branch, or Pull Request creation
- **Runs**: All tests in Ubuntu environment
- **Purpose**: Ensure code quality and prevent regressions

### Build and Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/build-release.yml`)

- **Trigger**: Pushing a tag with `v*` format (e.g., `v1.2.0`)
- **Workflow**:
  1. **Test Job**: Run all tests
  2. **Build Job**: Build executables on three platforms (only runs if tests pass)
  3. **Release Job**: Create GitHub Release and upload executables
- **Build Platforms**:
  - Windows (`.exe`)
  - macOS ARM (Apple Silicon)
  - Linux

## FAQ

### Q: What should I do if tests fail?

Check the error message, which usually indicates which test failed and why. You can run the failing test individually for debugging:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_card_designer.py::test_create_card_basic -v
```

### Q: How do I build the executable locally?

```bash
# Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# Build
pyinstaller --onefile --name pokemon-card-generator main.py

# The executable will be in the dist/ directory
```

### Q: Do I need to manually update the GitHub Release notes?

No, release notes are automatically generated based on the template in `.github/workflows/build-release.yml`. If you need to modify them, edit the `body` section in that file.

### Q: How do I add a new dependency?

```bash
# Add a runtime dependency
uv add package-name

# Add a dev dependency
uv add --dev package-name
```

This will automatically update `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.

### Q: The GitHub Actions build is failing, what should I check?

**Build fails on Windows:**
- Check if all required files exist
- Verify Python version compatibility

**Build fails on macOS:**
- Usually auto-resolved by GitHub Actions
- Check if dependencies are compatible with macOS

**Build fails on Linux:**
- Verify all system dependencies are available
- Check the error logs in GitHub Actions

**Executable is too large (>100MB):**
- This is normal! PyInstaller bundles Python + all dependencies
- Typical size: 50-80MB per executable

### Q: Can I test the release workflow without creating a real release?

Yes, use the manual trigger:
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select "Build and Release Executables"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose your branch

This will build executables but won't create a release (because no tag was pushed).
